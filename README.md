## Using This Template

To start a project using this template, click the "Use this template" button in the upper right corner of the GitHub repository. Choose an appropriate name and clone the new repository using Git. Finally, update the package name in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-vex-robot"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

You can also configure your program slot and upload behavior in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package.metadata.v5]
slot = 1
icon = "cool-x"
compress = true
```

> See our [Building & Uploading tutorial](https://vexide.dev/docs/building-uploading/) for more information.

## Getting Started (Windows)

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install `rustup`.

Run the following commands in Powershell to set up your PC for development on Windows.

- Switch to the `nightly` rust toolchain and add the `rust-src` component:

  ```console
  rustup default nightly
  rustup component add rust-src
  ```

- Install cargo-v5:

  ```console
  cargo install cargo-v5
  ```

## Getting Started (macOS)

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install `rustup` on your Mac.

Run the following commands in a terminal window to setup development with vexide.

- Open a terminal and configure `rustup` to build for the V5's platform target:

- Switch to the `nightly` rust toolchain and add the `rust-src` component:

  ```console
  rustup default nightly
  rustup component add rust-src
  ```

- Install cargo-v5:

  ```console
  cargo install cargo-v5
  ```

## Getting Started (NixOS)

The Nix flake includes a devshell with every tool you need for building and uploading vexide projects.

There is a `.envrc` file for Nix + Direnv users.

## Getting Started (Debian/Ubuntu Linux)

Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install `rustup`. You may also prefer to install it from your system package manager or by other means. Instructions on that can be found [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html).

Run the following terminal commands to set up development on Debian or Ubuntu.

- Switch to the `nightly` rust toolchain and add the `rust-src` component:

  ```console
  rustup default nightly
  rustup component add rust-src
  ```

- Install cargo-v5:

  ```console
  cargo install cargo-v5
  ```

## Getting Started (Fedora Linux)

Run the following terminal commands to set up your PC for development on Fedora.

- Install Rust:

  ```console
  sudo dnf install rustup
  rustup-init -y --default-toolchain nightly
  ```

- Close and reopen the terminal, and finish installing vexide:

  ```console
  rustup component add rust-src
  cargo install cargo-v5
  ```

An [API reference](https://docs.rs/vexide) is also provided by docs.rs.

## Development

### Compiling and uploading to a VEX V5 robot

Use the cargo-pros terminal utility to build and upload this vexide project.

```console
cargo v5 build
```

Use a USB cable to connect to your robot brain or to your controller before using the `upload` subcommand to build and upload the project. Make sure to specify a program slot.

```console
cargo v5 upload
```

### Viewing program output

You can view panic messages and calls to `println!()` using the PROS terminal.
Use a USB cable to connect to your robot brain or controller, then start the terminal:

```console
cargo v5 terminal
```
